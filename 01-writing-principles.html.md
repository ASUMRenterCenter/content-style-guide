## Goals

With every piece of content we publish, we aim to:

* **Empower.** We want to help people understand our products by using language that encourages them to make the most of MailChimp.

* **Respect.** Treat readers with the respect they deserve. Put yourself in their shoes, and don’t patronize them. Respect their time—they have other things to do. Be considerate and inclusive. Don’t market at people; communicate with them.

* **Educate.** Tell readers what they need to know, not just what we want to say. Give them exactly the information they need, along with opportunities to learn more. Remember that you’re the expert, and readers don’t have access to everything you know.

* **Guide.** Be a tour guide for readers. Whether you’re guiding them through our marketing website, apps, or educational materials, communicate in a friendly and helpful way.

* **Speak truth.** Understand MailChimp's place in our customers’ lives. Avoid dramatic storytelling and grandiose claims. Focus on our real strengths.

## Principles

In order to achieve those goals, we make sure our content is:

* **Clear.** Understand the topic you’re writing about. Use simple words and sentences.

* **Useful.** Before you start writing, ask yourself, "What purpose does this serve? Who is going to read it? What do they need to know?"

* **Friendly.** Write like a human. Don’t be afraid to break a few rules if it makes your writing more relatable. All of our content, from splashy homepage copy to error messages, should be warm and friendly.

* **Appropriate.** Write in a way that suits the situation. Just like you do in face-to-face conversations, adapt your tone depending on who you're talking to and what you’re talking about.
