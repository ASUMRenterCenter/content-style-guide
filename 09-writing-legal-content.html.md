Millions of business around the world use MailChimp, so we publish different kinds of legal content to protect ourselves and our customers.

If you’re looking for information about laws that apply to non-legal content, see the following section: [Copyright and trademark]

## Public legal documents

Here are the legal documents that are on our website:

[Terms of use](http://mailchimp.com/legal/terms/)
[Acceptable use policy](http://mailchimp.com/legal/acceptable_use/)
[Privacy policy](http://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/)
[API use policy](http://mailchimp.com/legal/api_use/)
[Copyright policy](http://mailchimp.com/legal/copyright/)

We keep them all in one place on our [legal page](http://mailchimp.com/legal/).

Those policies apply to all of MailChimp’s users. The legal and communication teams work together to make them as transparent and easy to read as possible. When someone signs up to use MailChimp, they must agree to all of those terms.

These are drafted by the in-house legal team, then passed to the communications team to edit. The communications team will make edits and add comments, then pass them back to the legal team for clarifications and approval. There’s usually a lot of back-and-forth between the legal and communications teams. Once everyone is happy and signed off, the legal team sends it off to outside counsel for one last review. After all that, we have to notify all our users of the change and provide a window for them to object before the new terms go into effect.

### Guides and articles about legal topics

We also publish guides and knowledge base articles about legal concepts that may affect our users. Here are some examples:

- [Terms of Use and anti-spam requirements](http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/compliance-tips/terms-of-use-and-anti-spam-requirements-for-campaigns)
- [About the Canada anti-spam law](http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/compliance-tips/about-the-canada-anti-spam-law-casl)
- [Stay compliant with CASL](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/managing-subscribers/stay-compliant-with-casl)

The legal team performs periodic reviews of all marketing and technical content to make sure all related links and information is up to date.

### Customer service messages

We respond to legal questions from customers every day. We answer common CAN SPAM inquiries like “Why does my mailing address have to appear on campaigns?” We also see questions about our practices and policies, like “How long is data retained?” “Where are your servers located,” and “Why is my industry or content prohibited?”

The majority of customer communications are handled by our support team. If a user raises a legal issue, a support agent will send the proposed reply to the legal team for review. Customers may also contact the legal team directly.

Common issues can be reviewed and sent by a paralegal or other legal staff member. More complex issues or issues threatening litigation or criminal wrongdoing will be drafted by a paralegal and then escalated to a lawyer for review.

### Public communications

We may have to publish communications about security, privacy, and other corporate issues. This could come in the form of an email to customers, a blog post, a public statement, or a press release.

The communications team works with the legal team to write and publish these documents. They’re also reviewed by the executive team.

## Creating legal content


The writing, review, and publishing processes for legal content are a different than what we’re used to. The most important difference: All legal content either starts with or passes through the legal team.

### Goals

Legal content doesn’t have to be a slog to get through, and we try to present our legal information in the most pleasant way possible. Good legal content is:

Accurate. The first and foremost concern for legal content is accuracy.
Clear. We try to avoid legal jargon and overly formal wording. Our customers need to understand the agreements they’re making with us.
Succinct. Most legal documents are much longer than necessary.

### Guidelines

#### Start with the facts.
We have some standard language around common issues or requests, but since legal content is so fact-specific, we start there before getting into structure and format. That’s why you won’t see many templates for our legal content.

#### Never offer legal advice.
While we want to inform our users about legal issues related to their use of MailChimp, we can’t offer them legal advice. Sometimes it’s a fine line. The legal department will check for this in their content review.

#### Use plain language

Legal content is serious business, so the tone is slightly more formal than most of our content. That said, we want all of our customers to be able to understand our legal content. So whenever possible, we use plain language rather than legal jargon.

Instead of: “If an individual purports, and has the legal authority, to sign these Terms of Use electronically on behalf of an employer or client then that individual represents and warrants that they have full  authority to bind the entity herein to the terms of this hereof agreement”

We say: “If you sign up on behalf of a company or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to accept these Terms on their behalf.”

You’ll notice we can’t remove all the legal terms, but we par it down to only what’s necessary. There are some legal terms we have to include because either there’s not a sufficient plain language alternative, or case law or statute dictates that term has to be used for the contract to hold up in court. For example, sometimes we need to say “represent and warrant” instead of “confirm” or “agree.” If we use those terms, we can provide an example or quick definition to help people understand what they’re reading.

Some companies have complicated terms and write plain-language summaries so people can understand the agreement. We don’t summarize our legal content, but instead try to write the terms themselves in plain language. We use a sidebar to provide examples or links to further reading for people who want more context.

**Definitions**

Using plain language for the terms you define up front can make legal documents easier to read. You’ve probably read contracts that say something like “The Corporation” or “The User” throughout, instead of “we” (meaning the company) and “you” (meaning the user who is agreeing to the terms). There’s a quick fix for that. At the beginning of the document, say something like:

- MailChimp is owned and operated by The Rocket Science Group, LLC d/b/a MailChimp, a Georgia limited liability corporation (“MailChimp,” “we,” or “us”). As a customer of the Service or a representative of an entity that’s a customer of the Service, you're a “Member” according to this agreement (or “you”).

After that, you’re free to use “we,” “us,” “you,” and “your” throughout the rest of the agreement. That simple change makes the document much friendlier to read.

**Contractions**

We use contractions in many of our legal documents, which makes them sound more human and flow better with the rest of our content. Contracting words does not affect the validity of an agreement.

The exception is that if we’re writing an agreement specifically for an international audience, we don’t use contractions.
