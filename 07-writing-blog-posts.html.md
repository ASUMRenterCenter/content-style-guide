MailChimp’s [main blog](https://blog.mailchimp.com) features posts written by people from all over the office, not just people with “writer” in their job title. We love having in-office experts write about their work. That way, the person with the knowledge can better convey it, and we can help by brainstorming with them and editing them as much or as little as they need.

This section will focus on the main MailChimp blog, but we’ve also got a few department-specific blogs for our [design](http://creative.mailchimp.com), [engineering](http://devs.mailchimp.com/blog/), and [technical content](http://docmakers.mailchimp.com) teams.

## Basics 

We update the main MailChimp blog a couple times every week. Here are the types of posts we generally publish:

* Feature, release, and integration announcements
* MailChimp user case studies
* Instructive tips and tricks for small businesses
* Examples of how we use MailChimp’s features in our own marketing

Our blog posts explain the "why" behind the work we do at MailChimp, while showing how we’re an industry leader with the best products. Tell the stories behind features and tools, so customers can see why they're useful. If you're writing about data, put the numbers in context. If you're writing about our customers, give the reader plenty of information about the company's stage, workflow, results, and values.

Our publishing process leaves plenty of room for learning as you go. Working on a blog post? Here are some tips to help you write the post and navigate WordPress Admin.

## Guidelines

### Be casual, but smart.
This isn’t a term paper, so there’s no need to be stuffy, but be smart. You know what you’re talking about—that’s why you’re writing the blog post. Drop some knowledge while casually engaging your readers with conversational language.

### Use title case in headlines.
Which is to say: Capitalize the Important Words. Articles (a, and, the) and prepositions (for, to, as, by, of, etc.) should be lowercase in headlines. (Use sentence case in subheadlines, though. For example, the subhed above this paragraph.)

### LOL
MailChimp is a fun company, and our blog should reflect that. Feel free to throw in a joke here and there. Don’t overdo it, though—forced humor is never funny.

### Get to the point.
Get to the important stuff right away, and don’t bury the kicker. Blog posts should be scannable, shareable, and easy to digest. Break up your paragraphs into short chunks of three or four sentences, and use subheads so distracted readers don’t lose focus. Our users are busy folks, and we should always keep that in mind.

### Use pictures
Include images in your blog posts when it makes sense. If you’re explaining how to use MailChimp, include screenshots to illustrate your point.

## WordPress tips
If you haven’t blogged for MailChimp before, your first order of business is setting up a WordPress Admin account. Contact an editor on the marketing team to coordinate.

### Create a draft
Add a new post, and save it often as a draft.

### Title
Write a clear title that tells the reader what the post is about. Don’t forget title case.

### Images
Save images and add them directly from your computer using the “Add Media” button. There are 3 size options available: full (the largest option), column (which aligns with the text width), and half width (the smallest option). Depending on how large your original image is, some of the larger options might not be available. Remove image links, or link the image to the relevant URL. Make sure you label all your images with a description. See the [Accessibility] section for more on that.

### Tags
Remember to add keywords that apply to your article. Look through existing posts for common tags. If you’re not sure if a word should be a tag, it probably shouldn’t. Feel free to ask an editor for suggestions as well.

### Links
Include links to further reading. Feel free to link away from MailChimp if it helps you explain something. Link words within the body of your post, instead of saying something like "Read more" or “Click here.” Always click the “Open link in a new window/tab” box when linking.
