title: Welcome to the MailChimp Style Guide

We created this style guide after years of using a mishmash of different guides, along with a supplemental internal guide. Our publishing process was broken. Different teams had conflicting style standards, and writers didn’t know where to go with questions. This guide is designed to solve those problems.

### Our goals

With this guide, we aim to:

- Create clarity on style standards and answer common questions
- Promote clear, consistent, helpful, and thoughtful content
- Encourage teams to collaborate and share ideas within our organization
- Improve the writing experience and save writers time
- Improve the reading experience through all of the above

The MailChimp Style guide goes beyond grammar and style points. It’s not traditional in format or content. You’ll notice that we break a number of grammar rules for clarity, practicality, or preference.

We’ve divided the guide by topic, so you use it as a reference or browse in order—whichever you prefer. We’ve also made the entire guide searchable, so you can go straight to the item you’re looking for.

We regularly update this guide, and we welcome suggestions on how to improve it.
