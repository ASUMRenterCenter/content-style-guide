We aim to empower our customers, and one big way we do this is by being aware of our voice and our tone.

What’s the difference between voice and tone? Think of it this way: You have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. You might use one tone with your closest friends and family, and a different tone with your boss.

Your tone also changes depending on the emotional state of the person you’re addressing. You wouldn’t want to use the same tone of voice with someone who’s scared or upset as you would with someone who’s laughing.

The same is true for MailChimp. Our voice doesn’t change much from day to day, but our tone changes all the time.

## Voice

MailChimp’s voice is human. It’s familiar, friendly, and straightforward. Our priority is explaining our products and helping our users get their work done so they can get on with their lives. We want to educate people without patronizing or confusing them.

One way to think of our voice is to compare what it is to what it isn’t. MailChimp’s voice is:

* Fun but not childish
* Clever but not silly
* Confident but not cocky
* Smart but not stodgy
* Cool but not alienating
* Informal but not sloppy
* Helpful but not overbearing
* Expert but not bossy
* Weird but not inappropriate

## Tone

MailChimp’s tone is usually informal, but it’s always more important to be clear than entertaining. When you’re writing, consider the reader’s state of mind. Are they relieved to be finished with a campaign? Are they confused and seeking our help on Twitter? Are they open and curious about a post on our blog? Once you have an idea of their emotional state, you can adjust your tone accordingly.

MailChimp has a sense of humor, so feel free to be funny when it’s appropriate and when it comes naturally to you. But don’t strain to make a joke—forced humor can be worse than none at all. If you’re unsure, keep a straight face.

## A note about Freddie

Freddie is our mascot. He’s been around in various forms since MailChimp's beginning, and he captures the spirit of our brand’s personality. He smiles, winks, and sometimes high-fives, but he does not talk. Don't write in his voice.

## Style tips

Here are a few general guidelines for writing in MailChimp’s voice.

### Active voice

Use active voice. Avoid passive voice.

In active voice, the subject of the sentence does the action. In passive voice, the subject of the sentence has the action done to it.

- Yes: Kate logged into the account.
- No: The account was logged into by Kate.

Words like “was” and “by” may indicate that you’re writing in passive voice. Scan for these words and rework sentences where they appear.

One exception is when you want to specifically emphasize the action over the subject. In some cases, this is fine.

- Your account was flagged by our abuse team.

### Slang and jargon

Use plain English. If you need to use a technical term, briefly define it so lay readers can understand.

- MailChimp's ops team is constantly scaling our servers to ensure our users have a great experience with our products. One way we do this is with shards, or partitions that help us better horizontally scale our database infrastructure.

### Write positively

Use positive language rather than negative language. One way to detect negative language is to look for words like “can’t,” “don’t,” etc.

- Yes: To get a donut, stand in line.
- No: You can’t get a donut if you don’t stand in line.
