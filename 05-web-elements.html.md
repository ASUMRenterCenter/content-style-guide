Every big piece of content we write is supported by a number of smaller content elements. They serve various, specific functions, and are just as—if not more—important. This section lays out our style in regards to these web elements, plus our approach the tricky art of SEO.

## Guidelines

### Alt text

This is a way to label images, and is especially important for people who can’t see the images on our website. Alt text should describe the image in a brief sentence or two.

For more on how and why we use alt text, read the [Accessibility](TK) section.

### Buttons

Buttons should always contain actions. The language should be clear and concise. Capitalize every word, including articles. It’s OK to use an ampersand in button copy.

Standard website buttons include:

- Log In
- Sign Up Free
- Subscribe
- Email Us

### Checkboxes

Use sentence case for checkboxes.

### Dropdown menus

Use title case for menu names and sentence case for menu items.

### Forms

Form titles should clearly and quickly explain the purpose of the form.

Use title case for form titles and sentence case for form fields.

Keep forms as short as possible.

Only request information that we need and intend to use. Don’t ask for gender or anything that could be considered private or personal.

### Headings and subheadings

Headings and subheadings help organize content for readers.

Headings (rendered in HTML as `<h1>`) give people a taste of what they’re about to read. They come before the rest of the copy on the page. Be generous and descriptive with your headings.

Subheadings (`<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.) break articles into smaller, more specific sections. They give readers avenues into your content and make it more scannable.

Headings and subheadings should be organized in a hierarchy, with heading first, followed by subheadings in order. (An `<h2>` will nestle under `<h1>`, an `<h3>` under `<h2>`, and on down.)

Include the most relevant keywords in your headings and subheadings, and make sure you cover the main post of the content.

Headings are written in title case, and subheadings are sentence case.

### Links

Provide a link whenever you’re referring to something on an external website. Use links to point users to relevant content and trusted external resources.

Don’t include preceding articles (a, an, the, our) when you link text. For example:

- Yes: Read the [automation guide](link) for details.
- No: Read [the automation guide](link) for details.

If a link comes at the end of a sentence or before a comma, don’t link the punctuation mark.

Don’t say things like “Click here!” or “Click for more information” or “Read this.” Write the sentence as you normally would, and link relevant keywords.

When you’re linking anchors within a single piece, wait to do so until the piece is done. This will help you make sure all the links are necessary and streamline the process.

Links should look different than regular copy, strong text, or emphasis text. They should have a hover state that communicates they’re interactive, and should have a distinct active and visited state. When setting the hover state of links, be sure to include focus state as well, to help readers using assistive technologies and touch devices.

### Lists

Use lists to present steps, groups, or sets of information. Give context for the list with a brief introduction. Number lists when the order is important, like when you’re describing steps of a process. Don’t use numbers when the list’s order doesn’t matter. 

If one of the list items is a complete sentence, use proper punctuation and capitalization on all of the items. If list items are not complete sentences, don’t use punctuation, but do capitalize the first word of each item.

### Navigation

Use title case for main navigation. Use sentence case for subnavigation.

Navigation links should be clear and concise.

### Radio Buttons

Use sentence case for radio buttons.

### Related articles

Sometimes a long piece of copy will lend itself to a list of related links at the end. Don’t go overboard—four is usually plenty.

Make sure related articles appear in a logical order, following the step down/step up rule: The first article should be a step down in complexity from the current article. The second one should be a step up in complexity to a more advanced article.

Don’t repeat links from the body text in related articles.

### Titles

Titles organize pages and guide readers. A title appears at the beginning of a page or section and briefly describes the content that follows.

Tiles are (you guessed it) in title case.

Don’t use punctuation in a title unless the title is a question.

## SEO

We write for humans, not machines. We don't use gross SEO techniques, like keyword stuffing, to bump search results. But we also want to make it easy for people and search engines to find and share our content. Here are some not-icky ways to do this:

* Organize your page around one topic. Use clear, descriptive terms in titles and headings that relate to the topic at hand.

* Use descriptive headings to structure your page and highlight important information.

* Give every image descriptive alt text.
