Social media is a great way to build relationships with MailChimp customers and share all the cool stuff we do. But it also creates opportunities to say the wrong thing, put off our customers, and damage our brand. So we’re careful and deliberate in what we post to our social channels.

MailChimp’s content values hold true in our approach to social media. We want to speak to our customers and get them excited about MailChimp. We want to promote our work and company culture. And we want to position ourselves as leaders in our field.

Here are some general guidelines for how to write thoughtfully and effectively for MailChimp’s social media channels.

## Write short, but smart

Some social media platforms have an official character limit. Others don’t. But for the most part, we keep our social media copy short.

- Twitter: 125 characters or less (this leaves room for a manual retweet and comments)
- Facebook: Facebook doesn’t have a character limit, but aim for one to two short sentences.
- Instagram: Instagram doesn’t have a character limit either, but try to keep text here to one sentence. Feel free to throw in an emoji or two.

Aim to write short by simplifying your ideas or reducing the amount of information you’re sharing—not by altering the spelling or punctuation of the words themselves. It’s fine to use the shorter common version of some words, like “info” instead of “information.” But avoid numbers and letters in place of words, like “4” instead of “for” or “u” instead of “you.” All other MailChimp style guidelines apply.

## Engagement

Do your best to adhere to MailChimp style guidelines when you’re using our social media channels to correspond with customers.

When appropriate, tag the subject of your post. Avoid directly tweeting or otherwise publicly tagging a post subject with messages like, “Hey, we wrote about you!”

Never ask for retweets, likes, or favorites.

## Hashtags

Employ hashtags rarely and deliberately. We may use them to promote an event or connect with users at a conference. Do not use hashtags for current events to promote MailChimp.

## Trending topics

Do not comment on trending topics or current events that are unrelated to MailChimp.

If you publish social content for MailChimp, be aware of what’s going on in the news. During major breaking news events, turn off all promoted and scheduled social posts.
